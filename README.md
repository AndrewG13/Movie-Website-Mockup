Streaming Service Project for CMPT330

What we offer:
This project will focus on building a video/movie streaming website.  Users will be able to browse through our ever expanding library, and select their favorite pieces to watch!  

The user experience:
Upon launching our website, users will be brought to the homepage (homepage.html), and will be shown some options on where to proceed, including logging in or signing up (login.html), visiting our about page (about.html), or seeking assistance by clicking on the help link (help.html).  Once signed in, the user will be brought back to the homepage to view the website's details (logo, tagline, etc what youd see in a typical homepage), as well as trending content and such.  Users can navigate to the browsing webpage (browse.html) by clicking on the designated button.  There, users will be displayed current streams available, and some upcoming.
